# ADS1115_IDF

ADS1115 library for the espressif IDF environment. 

Library handles the I2C communication (however must be pre-configured) *no semaphores are used, so these will need to be added manually if needed.

See the basic example (and others when added) for implimentation and header file for notable comments.
